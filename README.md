# Desktop Metronome

A metronome built with kotlin multi-platform/ desktop. UI is build with jetpack compose. This project was made to practice jetpack compose.
The polyrhtyhm mode doesn't work perfectly as the way we are reading sound files and producing the sound is not optimal but the normal mode works perfectly

Use Intellij Idea to build the project.

## Todo
- [ ] Build/find a library to smoothen the audio playing
- [ ] Create installers for multiple platforms (.msi, .dmg etc)
